  <p>By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and all applicable data protection laws.</p>

  <h4>Disclosure in Chat Rooms or Forums</h4>

  <p>You should be aware that identifiable personal information--such as your name or e-mail address--that you voluntarily disclose and that is accessible to other users (e.g. on bulletin boards or in chat areas) could be collected and disclosed by others. SmartOn cannot take any responsibility for such collection and disclosure.</p>

  <h4>Use of Cookies</h4>

  <p>The SmartOn website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p><br>

  <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize SmartOn pages, or register with SmartOn site or services, a cookie helps SmartOn to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same SmartOn website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the SmartOn features that you customized.</p><br>

  <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the SmartOn services or websites you visit.</p>

  <h4>Opt-Out & Unsubscribe</h4>

  <p>We respect your privacy and give you an opportunity to opt-out of receiving announcements of certain information. Users may opt-out of receiving any or all communications from SmartOn by contacting us here:</p>

  <h4>Links</h4>

  <p>SmartOn's websites or services may include links to third party websites. In using such links, please be aware that each third party website is subject to its own privacy and data protection policies and is not covered by our privacy policy. In addition, we allow third party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our websites. These companies may be placing and reading cookies in the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk or using web beacons or other technologies to collect information in the course of ads being served on this website. These companies may use information other than personal information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to these and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. To opt-out of this type of advertising, follow the instructions for opting out provided in the third party ad servers' privacy and data protection policies.</p>

  <h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>

  <p>Please note that SmartOn's Privacy Policy is reviewed periodically. SmartOn reserves the right to modify its Privacy Policy at any time without notice. Any changes to the policy will be posted on this page.</p>

  <p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will inform you (before collecting your data) and shall seek your consent to use your data for such marketing purposes or to disclose your information to any third party for such marketing purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the consent forms we use when collecting your personal data.</p>
